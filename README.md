### Game Title TBD ###

This is a web browser game I am currently producing as a project of mine over winter break. I am doing this to create a full stack project on my own as practice. This project is being coded in Typescript using the React framework and using 
Tailwind for css. I also intend to use MongoDB for the back-end of the project. I am still working on a general theme/direction for the game as of right now the design is simple and practical so that I can begin working on the functionality of 
the whole project before focusing on details of the game itself.

Current Features:
-Username is tracked using query parameters
-Game where the objective is to dodge circle objects with your mouse cursor is functional
-When your cursor collides with a circle object the game ends
-Once the game is over your score {time you lasted in seconds} is stored in the Leaderboard page

Features I plan to add:
-Severside Database to keep track of players scores from multiple different users
-Leaderboard to display your highest score and top 10 scores in the database
-Title for the game and more direction for style/theme
-More game features in general for higher replayability and enjoyment
-General styling changes and updates









This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
